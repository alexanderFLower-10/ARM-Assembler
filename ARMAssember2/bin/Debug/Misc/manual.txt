Instruction Manual for Assembly Learning Tool (Based on AQA Instruction Set)

Step 1 (Creating a file):
> Create a new file in the debug folder of the .asm (for editing in visual studio *reccomended) or .txt (for editing in notepad)
> Refer to AQA Instruction set for making this and remember to add a HALT statement
> Ensure to save file before running program

Step 2:
> You can then choose to either load your program or view/attempt challenges

Load a program:
> When loading a program, you will be prompted with any parsing errors that occur if any do occur
> If not, you will then be greeted with a console GUI
> From there you can utilise the keybinds to run and debug any assembly program

View/Attempt a challenge;
> There is 2 categories of challenges, AQA (Real questions from past AQA papers) and Others (Challenges made by me including 3 categories: easy, medium and hard)
> Once selected a category, you will then be greeted with a challenge, you can cycle through each challenge via the arrow keys
> After making an attempt at a challenge and referring to step 1 to ensure it is in the right place, you can then attempt it
> This runs your program against my assembly coded solution to the program, and will compare outputs
